# Go Mode Android Shell

The Android shell is the native half of Go Mode. It hosts a service frontend in a
WebView and adds native capabilities through service-neutral contracts.

The shell must not import product SDK DTOs, hard-code product REST routes, or
branch on voice provider names. Product-specific state is accessed through the
Go Mode manifest and MCP resources.

## Responsibilities

Android owns:

- service URL bootstrap
- WebView hosting
- native bridge compatibility checks
- microphone permission and audio routing
- WebRTC client setup
- local service tool execution during voice sessions
- notification and background monitoring behavior
- local SKILL.md activation policy

The host owns product auth, hosted UI, MCP endpoints, and product resource
semantics.

## Bootstrap

1. Load the configured service URL in the WebView.
2. Fetch `/.well-known/gomode.json` outside the WebView critical path.
3. Decode and validate Go Mode compatibility.
4. Enable native MCP-backed features only after compatibility passes.
5. Retry manifest fetch after page loads, app resume, network recovery, and user
   actions that need native features.

States:

- **Unvalidated**: manifest is unavailable or not decoded yet. WebView can load;
  native MCP-backed features are disabled.
- **Compatible**: manifest is available, API/bridge versions pass, and the
  skill catalog and voice gateway metadata decode.
- **Incompatible**: manifest is available but required fields or versions are
  unsupported.

## Hosted Authentication Lifecycle

The WebView exposes `window.gomodeAuth.postMessage(...)` only to the exact active
service origin through AndroidX WebView's message listener. The shell accepts
messages only from the main frame while the current page is still on that
origin. Hosts can send these JSON messages:

- `{ "bearerToken": "token" }` supplies an in-memory bearer for native MCP and
  voice requests and enables native service access after validation.
  `{ "bearerToken": null }` clears it and pauses native service access.
- `{ "authChanging": true }` begins a cookie-backed logout or account switch.
  It immediately disconnects voice and pauses native service monitoring.
- `{ "authChanged": true, "nativeAccess": true | false }` reports that the
  cookie-backed identity has settled, without sending a cookie through
  JavaScript. `nativeAccess` is true only for a confirmed signed-in user or a
  host with authentication disabled. False keeps native monitoring and voice
  unavailable on a login screen.

Send `authChanged` after resolving the identity in each newly loaded page. Send
`authChanging` before starting logout or account replacement, then send
`authChanged` with the correct `nativeAccess` value only after the cookie/session
update completes. If the result is
unknown because the request failed, keep native access paused until the host
validates the current identity. A 401 from the identity endpoint can settle
the state as logged out; an unrelated endpoint's 401 must keep access paused.
Bearer-backed hosts send the new bearer after validating it and clear it before
logout. The bridge stores no token on disk.

An accepted identity change or navigation away from the trusted origin stops
native voice and service monitoring in the WebView callback. Monitoring and
voice stay unavailable while auth is unsettled or the confirmed user lacks
native access. Monitoring restarts only after a settled signal granting access
or a validated bearer arrives. Voice MCP requests pin the
cookie and bearer captured at connection setup and reject a changed credential
before a tool request can leave the device.

## Skills

`webShell.toolGroups` is the bootstrap skill catalog. The canonical skill is a
`SKILL.md` file. The Markdown body is context for the voice/model session; the
frontmatter is the machine-readable contract:

- `name` and `description`
- `gomode.activation`: local `locations[]` hints with either `wifi.ssids` or
  `physicalPosition`; more activation signals can be added later
- `gomode.mcpServers[]`: MCP endpoint, protocol version, auth policy, and tool
  allowlist

See `../examples/tasks/SKILL.md` for a complete example with location-triggered
activation and multiple-MCP data.

Shell behavior:

- Load every skill's `name` and `description` from the manifest at bootstrap.
- Fetch the skill `SKILL.md` from `skillUrl` when available.
- Treat `gomode.activation` as local-only state; do not report considered
  locations to the service.
- On activation, connect to the skill's MCP endpoint, read `serverInstructions`,
  call `tools/list`, and register only tools in `gomode.mcpServers[].tools`.
- Deactivate skills when context no longer matches.
- Cap concurrently active skills.
- Namespace or reject colliding tool names.
- Surface active skills and tools, especially for screen-off voice.

caic currently exposes one `tasks` skill. The shell should still use the catalog
path so more skills can be added without a manifest contract change.

## MCP Client

The Android MCP client should support:

- `server/discover`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`
- `resources/list`
- `resources/templates/list`
- `resources/read`
- POST-based SSE `subscriptions/listen`

Use `server/discover` capabilities as the source of truth. Skip unsupported
features cleanly.

Subscription events are invalidations. On `notifications/resources/updated`,
re-read the resource. On `notifications/resources/list_changed`, re-read the
resource list.

## Service Status

The shell reads the generic `gomode://items` resource for native status:

- `id`: stable service-item identity
- `reference`: optional host-authored session-facing reference, such as `Task #3`
- `title`: user-visible item label
- `state`: optional user-visible status label
- `needsAttention`: whether the item requires user attention
- `omittedCount`: number of authoritative items excluded from the bounded resource
- `moreItemsHint`: host-authored guidance for retrieving omitted or newer detail

Hosts map product concepts to this schema. The shell parses only this generic
resource, maps only the native state it needs, and treats all product text as
untrusted. It does not import product SDK DTOs or hard-code product HTTP routes.

### Service-item voice context ownership

This is the canonical ownership contract for service-item voice context:

- The service backend owns the authoritative `gomode://items` facts, ordering,
  attention priority, stable references, omission metadata, and continuation
  guidance. Authorization is enforced before projecting the resource.
- Each Go Mode client owns the compact baseline placed in its particular voice
  session setup and bounds untrusted resource text.
- The voice gateway is transport-only. It forwards the client's opaque initial
  context to the selected model backend and neither interprets service items nor
  retains service-specific state.

On reconnect, the client reads or uses the freshest bounded service snapshot in
the new `session.setup`; conversation recovery context must not duplicate an
older service snapshot. A missing item resource produces an empty baseline,
not product-specific fallback behavior in the shell.

Clients seed their voice session from the current service snapshot and deliver
bounded changes from later snapshots, rather than appending complete state
repeatedly. Android compares generic service-item changes and resets its
baseline when the voice session or service identity changes. The caic browser
frontend derives its own product-specific task updates outside Go Mode. Both
voice transports buffer updates while the model is speaking.

## Service Notifications

A host may expose `gomode://notifications`, a JSON array of service-authored
notification events. Each event has a stable `id`, user-visible `title` and
`body`, plus `occurredAt` and `expiresAt` timestamps. The shell treats these
fields as untrusted display data, deduplicates by `id`, and publishes them on
its native alert channel. It does not infer product conditions from other
product resources.

Hosts update this resource through `notifications/resources/updated`; clients
re-read it as an invalidation. Hosts own event generation, retention, and
expiry. The shell owns permission handling and delivery.

## Voice Session Setup

Voice setup uses the manifest, not product constants:

1. Resolve `webShell.voiceGateway.url` relative to the service URL.
2. If external gateway auth is required, request a token from
   `webShell.voiceGateway.tokenEndpoint`.
3. Open the voice gateway signaling route.
4. Attach the `voice-gateway` data channel.
5. Merge active service MCP tools with Android-native tools.
6. Read and bound the current `gomode://items` baseline.
7. Send that baseline in `session.setup.context.text` before the first response.
8. Execute service tool calls locally through the active skill MCP endpoint.

The shell must not branch on Gemini, local stack, Parakeet, Qwen, Gemma, or any
other provider/runtime.

## Tests Needed

Unit tests:

- unavailable manifest leaves shell unvalidated
- incompatible versions disable native features
- missing skills disable MCP-backed features
- `server/discover` capability negotiation
- `resources/list` and `resources/read` request envelopes
- POST-based SSE parsing for `subscriptions/listen`
- resource update notification triggers re-read
- unsupported resource capabilities disable monitoring cleanly

Android/e2e tests:

- WebView loads in limited mode without valid manifest
- broken MCP does not block WebView load
- fake MCP resource listing drives monitoring without product REST routes
- fake resource update changes native monitoring state
- voice setup merges service MCP tools with Android-native tools
- multi-skill activation and deactivation change the active tool set
- untrusted skill instructions and tool descriptions are handled as data
