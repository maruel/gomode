# Go Mode Local Voice Stack

This plan defines the remaining gateway-side work to validate and harden the
local speech stack behind the voice gateway contract. Android and the hosted web
frontend should keep talking to the generated `sdk/voicegateway` API and
data-channel message types; they should not know which gateway backend serves a
session.

## Goal

Support voice sessions through one gateway protocol that can be used by both
Android and browser clients while hiding backend implementation details:

- Android owns microphone permission, audio routing, foreground service
  lifecycle, WebRTC client setup, active-skill tool execution, and service HTTP
  calls.
- The browser frontend owns browser media APIs, WebRTC client setup,
  active-skill tool execution, and service HTTP calls.
- The gateway owns media conversion, model/provider transport, ASR/LLM/TTS
  orchestration, turn state, and interruption handling.
- Service backends own product APIs, auth, hosted frontend content, service
  context, SKILL.md files, and MCP tool manifests.

The client-visible contract is a voice-gateway session. It is not Gemini Live,
Gemini Bidi, local stack, Parakeet, Gemma, Qwen, or any other
provider/runtime.

## Constraints

- The gateway/backend can run on macOS or Linux.
- The first local stack implementation targets macOS.
- Android WebRTC stays in scope for both first backends.
- Browser WebRTC uses the same gateway protocol when hosted frontend voice is
  enabled.
- `sdk/voicegateway/API.md` is the client contract. The gateway is the
  abstraction boundary between clients and model providers.
- Service-specific tool execution stays out of the gateway. Android or the
  frontend activates SKILL.md files, executes allowed MCP tool calls, and returns
  tool results.
- Provider names and provider message schemas stay out of Android and frontend
  public types, data-channel messages, and UI state.
- `/api/voicegateway/v1/...` remains the only advertised voice gateway contract
  until the abstraction and backend split are complete. Add `/api/v2/...` only
  after that work lands.
- The first local stack should be half-duplex unless smoke tests prove that
  streaming ASR and streaming local TTS are reliable on the target Mac.

## Current State

A voice-gateway instance serves exactly one backend, chosen by config. Offering
more than one profile means running more than one instance and pointing clients
at different URLs. Selection happens by URL, not by a per-request profile.

`local-stack` is half-duplex. It segments decoded mic PCM with energy VAD,
runs ASR and LLM through separate llama.cpp-backed providers by default,
normalizes tool calls and tool results over the provider-neutral data channel,
cancels the active turn on barge-in, and synthesizes assistant speech through a
KittenTTS Python worker behind the `ttsAdapter` seam.

Go Mode voice sessions include tools. Every LLM turn, including continuations
after tool results, keeps tools available. LLM text deltas from
`genai.Provider.GenStream` are sent to TTS as stable sentence fragments while
the stream is still running. Final stream results still drive conversation
history and tool-call emission. KittenTTS returns 24 kHz mono S16LE PCM,
matching the gateway's assistant PCM rate without resampling.

ASR and LLM each default to their own gateway-managed llama.cpp server: ASR
runs the dedicated `ggml-org/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0` speech-to-text model and
LLM runs `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`; the gateway owns both server
lifetimes independently. Operators that need custom llama.cpp process settings
should start their own server(s) and set `local_stack.asr.remote` and/or
`local_stack.llm.remote`. TTS currently has no config table; the gateway starts
a fixed KittenTTS worker with `uv`, Python 3.12, and a pinned Git revision.

Linux CPU-only evidence covers managed ASR/LLM/TTS wiring and full WebRTC
audio-path correctness only. Target-Mac latency, audio quality, setup behavior,
and runtime requirements remain unknown. Startup/setup time is logged
separately and must stay excluded from latency measurements.

## Target Architecture

```text
Go Mode Android / Hosted web frontend
  -> VoiceSession
      -> media endpoint
      -> WebRTC transport
      -> URL-selected gateway protocol
      -> active SKILL.md tool registry
      -> active service API client

voice-gateway (one instance == one backend)
  -> /api/voicegateway/v1/voice/rtc/offer
  -> WebRTC session manager
  -> gateway protocol normalizer (session.ready readiness signal)
  -> provider-neutral session core
      -> the one configured backend adapter:
           gemini-live (full duplex) OR local-stack (half duplex)

Active service backend
  -> hosted web frontend, service auth, token issuer, product API, SKILL.md files
  -> lists the available gateway URLs (one per backend/profile)
```

Public client contracts:

- WebRTC carries microphone RTP Opus and assistant RTP Opus.
- The data channel label is `voice-gateway`.
- Data-channel messages are UTF-8 gateway JSON messages.
- The HTTP signaling route version selects the data-channel schema before the
  session starts.
- Tool schemas and tool calls use provider-neutral JSON Schema-like shapes.

Internal gateway contracts:

- A backend adapter maps the normalized session into one provider/runtime.
- Backend IDs are allowed in gateway config, gateway logs, and gateway tests.
  They are not part of Android or frontend feature gates.

## Client Contract

Android and frontend use the generated voice gateway SDK and the route-selected
data-channel schema as their abstraction. They must not branch on backend IDs or
provider names.

Client rules (still binding):

- No Android or frontend source file constructs provider setup messages, imports
  provider realtime protocol types, contains provider WebSocket URLs/model
  constants/`BidiGenerateContent`/auth params, or branches on `gemini-live`.
- Provider-specific tool schema conversion happens inside gateway backend
  adapters.
- Clients persist no backend IDs and do not branch on provider/backend names.

## Provider-Neutral Data Channel

[`VOICE_GATEWAY.md`](VOICE_GATEWAY.md) is canonical for the public data-channel
messages. The local stack must implement that contract unchanged. This document
only adds local-runtime behavior: half-duplex ASR/LLM/TTS orchestration,
`session.ready` after gateway setup, tool continuation after client results, and
barge-in cancellation.

## Gateway Config

A gateway instance selects its single backend in static config:

```toml
# Gemini Live (full duplex, needs GEMINI_API_KEY):
backend = "gemini-live"

# or the local stack (half duplex, no key):
# backend = "local-stack"

# Omit these tables to let the gateway download and run its own llama.cpp
# servers: ASR with ggml-org/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0 (dedicated speech-to-text)
# and LLM with unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL (conversation and tools).
# Use remote only when you run llama-server yourself.
# [local_stack.asr]
# provider = "llamacpp"
# remote = "http://localhost:8090"
# model = "ggml-org/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0"

# [local_stack.llm]
# provider = "llamacpp"
# remote = "http://localhost:8080"
# model = "unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL"
```

KittenTTS is started automatically for `local-stack`. It requires `uv` and a
Python 3.12 runtime; model and package caches live under the user cache
directory.

v1 has no capability negotiation: all instances share the same baseline protocol
and `session.ready` is a bare readiness signal. If public feature discovery is
needed later, add it under a future API version.

## Runtime Strategy

Use process adapters so the gateway is not coupled to one runtime or host OS.
The first implementation targets macOS. Linux support should use the same
adapter interfaces with different runtime choices when CUDA or other Linux
accelerators are available.

ASR backend candidates:

- `llamacpp-qwen3-asr`: wired path. The gateway sends segmented microphone PCM
  as inline WAV audio to a managed, dedicated Qwen3-ASR-0.6B llama.cpp server
  (`local_stack.asr`), independent from the conversational LLM server.
- `llamacpp-gemma4`: non-target fallback. Gemma is a conversational/tool model,
  not a dedicated speech-to-text model.
- `parakeet-nemo`: target model path. Requires smoke testing on macOS because
  official performance assumptions are CUDA-oriented.
- `parakeet-cpp`: investigate `mudler/parakeet.cpp` as a local C++ Parakeet
  runtime candidate for macOS feasibility.
- `parakeet-onnx`: investigate community or export path for CPU/CoreML/Metal
  feasibility.
- `whisper-cpp`: fallback baseline for macOS latency and audio pipeline
  testing. Since `ggml-org/whisper.cpp` v1.9.0 includes Parakeet support and
  `examples/parakeet-cli`, also evaluate it as a C++ Parakeet runtime path.
- Linux CUDA deployments may use the same ASR adapter contract with
  CUDA-oriented Parakeet/NeMo serving.

LLM backend candidates:

- `llamacpp`: GGUF quantization with Metal. This is the first wired local LLM
  adapter path. The gateway manages llama-server by default with internal
  process defaults. Operators that need custom llama.cpp flags, cache paths,
  thread counts, or builds should start llama-server themselves and set
  `local_stack.llm.remote`.
- `mlx`: MLX-format model or OpenAI-compatible MLX server.
- `openai-compatible`: future generic text-only LLM adapter to local HTTP
  servers; it is not the current ASR/tool-capable voice stack provider.
- Linux deployments may use the same `openai-compatible` adapter with vLLM,
  SGLang, llama.cpp, or another local server.

TTS backend paths:

- `kitten-tts-python`: wired path. `KittenML/kitten-tts-mini-0.8` generates
  24 kHz mono audio through ONNX on CPU, matching `backendOutputSampleRate`.
  The gateway runs it as an external `uv`/Python worker so Python packaging and
  model cache behavior stay outside the Go session loop.
- `qwen-tts-python`: comparison candidate if KittenTTS quality, latency,
  packaging, or streaming behavior is not acceptable on the target Mac.
- `qwen-tts-onnx`: investigate for lower-dependency local serving.
- `dashscope-qwen-tts`: optional hosted fallback for validating gateway
  protocol, not the local target.
- Linux CUDA deployments may use the same TTS adapter contract with the
  official CUDA/PyTorch-oriented Qwen3-TTS path.

KittenTTS runtime requirements and risks:

- The gateway pins a known working Git revision through `uv --with` because the
  published `kittentts-0.8.1` wheel did not match the worker API used here.
- Setup must use Python 3.12; Python 3.13 failed in the smoke environment while
  building transitive dependencies.
- The package dependency graph can pull large Python ML dependencies. Treat
  KittenTTS as an external runtime process with explicit setup and cache paths,
  not as Go-vendored application code.
- Cold setup is slow and variable, dominated by managed llama.cpp startup and
  Python/model cache state. This is setup time, not runtime latency.
- Hugging Face unauthenticated downloads work in smoke runs but emit rate-limit
  warnings. Operators may need `HF_TOKEN` for reliable cold setup.

## Streaming Constraints and Next Work

Current behavior and constraints:

- ASR is final-only. The local adapter waits for VAD end-of-speech, sends a
  complete in-memory WAV to Qwen3-ASR through `genai.Provider.GenSync`, and
  emits one user transcript delta.
- LLM turns use `genai.Provider.GenStream`. The gateway speaks `fragment.Text`
  deltas as stable sentence fragments and uses the final accumulated result for
  conversation history and tool-call emission.
- The sentence fragmenter preserves exact text order, emits on stable sentence
  punctuation or size limits, and holds trailing text until the next stable
  boundary or final flush.
- KittenTTS receives complete text fragments as separate requests and streams
  PCM for each request. It does not accept incremental text on an existing
  request.
- Diagnostics cover TTS first-audio time per fragment, assistant PCM buffer
  depth, and first assistant RTP timing.
- The WebRTC bridge drains assistant PCM at realtime from an in-memory buffer.
  Bounded backpressure is still missing, so TTS can queue audio ahead of
  playback.
- Partial ASR remains deferred until the protocol can mark transcript deltas as
  provisional or final and the selected ASR runtime exposes useful partial
  results.

## Remaining Work

1. Run the target-Mac smoke test and record post-startup ASR, LLM, TTS, tool,
   and full WebRTC turn latency. Do not measure RSS/memory and do not include
   runtime setup time in latency numbers.
2. Verify target-Mac audio quality and setup reliability for managed Qwen3-ASR,
   managed Gemma, and KittenTTS.
3. Add bounded assistant PCM backpressure so TTS cannot queue unbounded audio
   ahead of realtime RTP playback.
4. Document target-Mac runtime requirements if the smoke results are acceptable:
   Python version, `uv`, cache locations, Hugging Face token needs, and default
   managed model/runtime behavior.
5. Evaluate Parakeet, whisper.cpp, MLX, or Qwen3-TTS only if the measured
   default ASR/LLM/TTS path is unacceptable.

## Testing

- Go unit tests for protocol encoding/decoding/validation, backend config
  validation, and session setup failures.
- WebRTC bridge tests with fake media and fake model backends, including the
  local stack turn flow, tool round trips, and barge-in.
- Frontend unit tests for normalized data-channel message handling.
- Runtime smoke tests for ASR, LLM, TTS, tool continuation, and full WebRTC
  audio on the target Mac.
- Manual audio tests on real Android hardware for microphone routing,
  Bluetooth/SCO behavior, interruptions, and foreground service behavior.

## Open Decisions

- Exact target Mac model and RAM size for the first implementation.
- Minimum supported Linux runtime profile for later deployments.
- Whether Gemma remains on llama.cpp for the first target Mac after measured
  smoke tests, or moves to MLX/OpenAI-compatible serving.
- Whether Parakeet is viable on macOS without CUDA at acceptable latency.
- Whether KittenTTS quality and latency are acceptable on macOS, and whether
  complete-fragment PCM streaming is reliable enough for the local stack.
- Whether Qwen3-TTS remains worth testing locally if KittenTTS is acceptable.
- Whether Android and frontend share one SKILL.md frontmatter parser and tool
  declaration builder, or maintain separate implementations tested against the
  same golden skill files.
- Whether browser voice remains a product feature once Go Mode owns native
  voice, or becomes only a development/debug path.
- How the active service backend advertises and selects among multiple gateway
  instances/URLs when profile selection is by URL.

## Target-Mac Smoke Plan

Run runtime smoke on the target Mac and focus on target-specific measurements:

- Configure `backend = "local-stack"` and omit `[local_stack.asr]` and
  `[local_stack.llm]` for the managed defaults.
- Run `go test -tags="smoke" -run TestSmokeVoiceRTCLocalAudio -v -timeout 15m
./gomode/voicegateway/voicertc/`.
- Confirm managed llama.cpp and KittenTTS setup succeeds; report setup problems
  separately from latency measurements.
- Capture ASR latency, LLM turn latency, and tool-call behavior from the smoke
  test logs after managed llama.cpp is ready.
- Capture full real-stack WebRTC turn latency and audible assistant RTP output.
- Capture KittenTTS first-audio latency, synthesis latency, and audio quality
  after KittenTTS is ready.
- If acceptable, document the target-Mac runtime requirements and keep KittenTTS
  as the initial TTS implementation.
